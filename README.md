## Game Overview

**Brick'd Up** is a platformer puzzle game where you play as a stonemason climbing an ancient tower. Unlike traditional platformers, you don't just navigate the environment—you shape it! Use your masonry skills to place blocks strategically, creating platforms and pathways to ascend the tower while avoiding obstacles and collecting resources.

### Premise

As a skilled stonemason, you've been challenged to reach the pinnacle of a mysterious tower. Armed with only your building expertise and a small supply of blocks, you must navigate upward, gathering more materials and overcoming increasingly difficult challenges along your ascent.

### Goal

Progress through a series of checkpoints and ultimately reach the top of the tower to complete your journey. There's no time limit or scoring system—success is measured by how high you climb. Collect coins scattered around the levels for an extra challenge.
